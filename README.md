# MyWebApplication-PWII-

# Description

This is my first ever web page and I it is mainly done to learn how they are developed, how to use the huge amount of commands offered and take a "quick" look at web development and its possibilities. On it you will be able to find what Large Language Models are, what do they do and why they will become a crucial feature on artificial inteligence technology. Furthermore, you could discover about myself and why I ended up at this University and at this "uncommon" degree.


# Problems During Development

I did not face huge problems during the development of the web as I began with the assist of a Youtube video that actually helped a lot to understand how to organise the HTML code and the CCS's later design. Nevertheless, I had to deal with a problem with the images, because at first they did not appear on the page, but later I discovered that I miswritten the path. 
I had to cope too with the footer, because it did not fix its position to the bottom side, but it was quite simple to solve it. 
Moreover, when I tried to launch my web page on github, I realized that the path of both the images and the header were wrong, because they were specified as if the files had to be stored on the local system of the user. To solve it, I had to change their paths into relative paths. 


# Conclusions

This project has shown me the reality about web development and I have learned a lot about it. I discovered that the front-end layer is way simpler than the back-end and how "easy" is to create your own web page or web app. 
I have found out too Visual Studio Code and Git thanks to this project, giving me the opportunity to learn their huge amount of features and oportunities available and launching my first ever project on the internet.
